### Chat with bot
In Telegram search for **@OpenCryptoBot** (or click [here](https://telegram.me/OpenCryptoBot)) and you will find the bot.  

Once you found the bot, open a chat with him and press the *Start* button to access the bot. The bot will send you a list of all available commands that you can use. Click on a command to execute it or to see which arguments you have to provide to execute it properly.

### Add to group
It's also possible to add the bot to a Telegram group. Inside your group, in the upper right corner, open the menu and click on *Add Members* and then search for **@OpenCryptoBot**. Once you found the bot click on *Invite* and your done!

### Execute commands
In a chat with the bot or in a group, start typing `/` and you will see all available commands. You could choose one of the commands but done this way, most commands will only show you how to use them, since they mostly need additional arguments to return the data you want.

If you need details about how to use each command, take a look at the "Commands" section.

### Self-hosted
If you want to run the bot on your own for you personally or for a group, download the source code and run it locally on your own machine or on a server.  

For detailed instructions how to set the bot up and where to host it, see details on [GitHub](https://github.com/Endogen/OpenCryptoBot).
