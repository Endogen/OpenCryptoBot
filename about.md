OpenCryptoBot is an open source Telegram bot written in Python that provides you with everything crypto related.

Want to know the price of a coin? Want to see a chart or know the volume or market cap? See global stats or price changes over time or compare coins and get descriptions, see the logo, access info about the team that is developing it, the ICO or where to buy it? Not a big deal, it's all there just waiting for you to issue the command that returns you what you want to know.

The bot is free and everyone can use, change and extend it. Access the bot directly via [this link](https://telegram.me/OpenCryptoBot) or host and set it up yourself by taking a look at the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Endogen/OpenCryptoBot). You can also easily add the bot to your Telegram group. Check out the "How to Use" section.

Initially developed by Telegram user [endogen](https://telegram.me/endogen) as a truly free and clean alternative to the well known [CryptoWhale](https://whalebot.io) bot.

This bot is currently in active development and if you want to help out, check out the [repository](https://github.com/Endogen/OpenCryptoBot).
