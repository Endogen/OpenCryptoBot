Today is the day. After about two months in the making, i'm proud to release the first version 0.1.0 of *OpenCryptoBot*!

This initial release should already have the basic set of commands and run quite well. If you encounter any bugs or want some much needed features, let me know. I would really be glad if someone could thoroughly test the bot so that i can be sure that it doesn't include any serious bugs.
